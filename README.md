# DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS

## Overview of Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that allow efficient organization, management, and storage of data. Below is an overview of the listed data structures:

1. **Arrays**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow constant-time access to elements using an index but have fixed size and require resizing for dynamic operations.

2. **Graphs**: A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used to model relationships and networks, such as social networks, road maps, and dependency graphs.

3. **Hashmaps**: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Hashmaps provide average constant-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.

4. **Linked Lists**: A linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers. Linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions.

5. **Queues**: A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Queues are used in scenarios like task scheduling and buffering.

6. **Stacks**: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Stacks are used in function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking.

7. **Trees**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a parent and zero or more children. Trees are used in databases, file systems, and search algorithms.

# Arrays

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays allow for efficient indexing and manipulation of elements.

## Key Features
- **Fixed Size**: The size of an array is defined at the time of its creation and cannot be changed.
- **Indexed Access**: Elements in an array can be accessed using their index, starting from 0.
- **Efficient Traversal**: Arrays allow for quick iteration over elements.

## Common Operations
1. **Accessing Elements**: Retrieve an element using its index.
2. **Updating Elements**: Modify an element at a specific index.
3. **Traversing**: Iterate through all elements in the array.
4. **Searching**: Find the index of a specific element.
5. **Sorting**: Arrange elements in a specific order.


## Advantages
- Simple and easy to use.
- Direct access to elements using indices.

## Limitations
- Fixed size, which may lead to wasted memory or insufficient space.
- Insertion and deletion operations can be costly as they may require shifting elements.

Arrays are a fundamental building block in data structures and are widely used in algorithms and programming.
